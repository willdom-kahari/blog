# Core Concepts

1. Thread Fundamentals
    - Difference between Process and Thread
    - Thread lifecycle (NEW, RUNNABLE, BLOCKED, WAITING, TIMED_WAITING, TERMINATED)
    - Ways to create threads: extending `Thread` class vs implementing `Runnable` interface

2. Thread Synchronisation
    - Understanding race conditions
    - `synchronized` keyword (methods and blocks)
    - Intrinsic locks and their re-entrant nature
    - Volatile variables

3. Java Memory Model
    - Happens before relationship
    - Visibility and atomicity concerns
    - Memory barriers

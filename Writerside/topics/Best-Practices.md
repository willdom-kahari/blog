# Best Practices
1. Thread Safety Principles
    - Immutability as a thread-safety strategy
    - Confinement (thread, stack, object)
    - Safe publication patterns

2. Common Pitfalls
    - Deadlocks and how to avoid them
    - Livelocks and starvation
    - Premature optimisation in concurrent code

3. Debugging and Testing
    - Use thread dumps to diagnose issues
    - Writing effective multithreaded unit tests
    - Stress testing concurrent code

# Introduction

## Learning Resources
1. Books
    - "Java Concurrency in Practice" by Brian Goetz et al. (essential)
    - "The Art of Multiprocessor Programming" by Maurice Herlihy & Nir Shavit

2. Online Resources
    - Oracle's Java Concurrency Tutorial
    - Javadocs for java.util.concurrent package
    - Java Memory Model documentation

3. Practical Exercises
    - Implement producer-consumer patterns
    - Build a thread-safe cache
    - Create a custom thread pool
    - Solve classical concurrency problems (dining philosophers, readers-writers)

## Hands-on Approach
The best way to master multithreading is through practice:
1. Start with simple thread creation and synchronisation
2. Gradually move to more complex scenarios
3. Use tools like VisualVM to monitor thread behaviour
4. Experiment with different synchronisation mechanisms
5. Profile performance to understand tradeoffs

Remember that multithreading bugs can be subtle and hard to reproduce. Always test thoroughly and consider thread safety from the beginning of your design process.
